## Introduction

My second project during my Web Development Immersive Course at General Assembly in London, Sage Health is a way for patients to communicate with surgeons and seek treatments. 

## How to use Sage

Sage is a platform providing patients with a way to access the best doctors for advice. There are two main routes for the users to open consultations: 

 1. make a direct request 
 2. book next available appointment

 ⋅⋅1. Patients log in and make a direct request to a particular doctor. Doctors log in to find their direct requests. They can accept the requests for to open a consultation. 

 ⋅⋅2. To book a quick appointment with the next available doctor, patients log in and open a case. Doctors can log in and find a list of patients waiting to be consulted.

Once an appointment is made, doctors converse with patients and when a diagnosis is made, doctors can offer a treatment and close the case.
